## **Overall Analysis**

Two drugs, Capomulin and Ramicane, show promise as drug treatments. Mice treated with these drugs have far greater survival rate than those treated with a placebo.

Additionally, both drugs have demonstrated the ability to not only suppress tumor growth, but decrease tumor size. Both drugs had a median tumor volume, for the cohorts as a whole, that was less than the initial tumor volume. Indeed, 75% of mice in these cohorts showed a decrease in tumor size.

I recommend the selection of Capomulin and Ramicane for further study. We should employ larger cohorts and evaluate these findings statistically versus a null hypothesis.
